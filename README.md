# ScatWave

ScatWave is a Torch implementation of scattering and other mathematical representations using CUDA libraries, designed for images, sounds, natural language processing and video.

# How to install

Assuming Torch is already installed on your computer, simply cd in scatwave_pkg, then 'luarocks make'

# Few results...

With this incorrect implementation and a buggy NN script(out of the confusion matrix script that I did not write) : 75%
20ms/image for 256x256 images
